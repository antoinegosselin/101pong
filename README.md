# 101pong
Project 101pong for B1 - Mathematics at Epitech

Project done in duo with Nathan Lecorchet @HeyShafty

Goal of the project:

The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the
Breakout
game by the way. . . ). Only
one bat will be considered, moving only in the 0-altitude plan (which happens to be (Oxy)).

Your program must print:

•The velocity vector of the ball,

•The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time,

•The angle at which the ball will hit the bat (if it will indeed hit the bat, at anytime from t = 0).

Bonus:

A pong game in CSFML
